### Core java concepts 
 1) Wrapper classes 
     -> Class is final 
     -> instance are immutable 
     -> Read, not write 
     -> includes hashcode, toString(), equals() 
     -> We can add helper methods 
     -> Classes can be serializable and comparable 
     
 2) Enumeration 
       -> How to use enum classes with demo examples
       
 3) Annotations
      -> This is form of metaData 
      -> Create custom annotation creation 
 
 4) Serialization and Deserialization in java 
      -> In enterprise java it is quite common to have producer and consumer application 
      when one application would like to send their java object to another application over the network in the form of byte then 
      the whole process is called Serialization exact opposite to converting bytes to java object is deserialization.
      
      -> Transient -- if you dont want particular variable to get serialized we use transient key word
      
      
 5) MultiThreading in Java 
        --> Difference between thread and runnable
        --> Threads will run in parallel and not in sequence 
        --> Objects has properties and states 
        --> Two threads trying to access same objects?
        --> Intrinsic Locks and synchronization ?
        --> Method synchronized or thread sensitive code block 
        --> DeadLock 
        --> Fork-join framework for compute intensive tasks, the fork-join framework
           distribute a certain task on several workers [https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/forkjoinpool-class-in-java-with-examples/, https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaConcurrency/article.html#completablefuture]
        
 
 6) Functional Interface 
 
        --> Any interface that has only  method is known  as functional interface 
        
        
 7) Auto boxing unboxing 
        --> Automatic conversion  between primitive dataTypes and their wrapper class [ vise versa]

8)  I/O streams in java 

        --> fies, devices 
        --> input and output travel via streams
        --> Input stream and output stream 
        --> 
 
 
9) Working with LocalDateTim?


### Topic: Java 8 Streams & Lambda's and functional programming

 * function take one argument and produce one result and
 * Bi-function takes two arguemnts and produces one result 
 * Consumer  takes one argument  return void 
 
 * Lambda Expressions enable you to encapsulate a single unit of behavior and pass it to other code.
 * lambda expression used for to write less efficiens
 * know much information about Collections and Comparator 
 
 
### Topic : conditional loops 
 switch statement 
  --> it doesn't support data type long 
  --> what to choose between if else and switch?
