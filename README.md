### Core java concepts 
 1) Wrapper classes 
     -> Class is final 
     -> instance are immutable 
     -> Read, not write 
     -> includes hashcode, toString(), equals() 
     -> We can add helper methods 
     -> Classes can be serializable and comparable 
     
 2) Enumeration 
       -> How to use enum classes with demo examples
       
 3) Annotations
      -> This is form of metaData 
      -> Create custom annotation creation 
 
 4) Serialization and Deserialization in java 
      -> In enterprise java it is quite common to have producer and consumer application 
      when one application would like to send their java object to another application over the network in the form of byte then 
      the whole process is called Serialization exact opposite to converting bytes to java object is deserialization.
      
      -> Transient -- if you dont want particular variable to get serialized we use transient key word
